\title{THE MULTIVERSE VIEW ON THE AXIOM OF CONSTRUCTIBILITY
}

\abstract{
I shall give a talk on the multiverse perspective on the axiom of constructibility. Set theorists often look down upon the axiom of constructibility $V=L$ as limiting, in light of the fact that all the stronger large cardinals are inconsistent with this axiom, and furthermore the axiom expresses a minimizing property, since $L$ is the smallest model of ZFC with its ordinals. Such views, I argue, stem from a conception of the ordinals as absolutely completed. A potentialist conception of the set-theoretic universe reveals a sense in which every set-theoretic universe might be extended (in part upward) to a model of $V=L$. In light of such a perspective, the limiting nature of the axiom of constructibility tends to fall away.
